<h2>üöÄ Cybersecurity Challenges:</h2>

* **2025 National Cyber League (NCL), Spring Individual Game ([Scouting Report](https://cyberskyline.com/report/M2WX7H9PTVYN)):** Placed **1455th out of 8573 participants (84th percentile overall)**, demonstrating strong capabilities across multiple domains. My key strengths include:
    * **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to identify malicious and benign activity. Cracked Wi-Fi passwords by discovering handshake packets and leveraging aircrack-ng.
    * **Web Application Exploitation:** Exploited directory traversal vulnerabilities in web applications to access restricted files.
    * **Password Cracking:** Identified password hash algorithms using hash-identifier. Cracked identified hashes (e.g., MD5, NTLM) with hashcat.

* **2025 NCAE Cyber Games Competition, Southwest Regional:** Achieved **Third Place**. I led a Red vs. Blue team event, specifically responsible for the configuration and management of a Linux BIND DNS server. Our team was the first to successfully deploy our DNS server.
