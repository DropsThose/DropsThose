    * **Web Application Exploitation (91st percentile):** Exploited directory traversal vulnerabilities in web applications to access restricted files.
    * **Password Cracking (88th percentile):** Identified password hash algorithms using hash-identifier. Cracked identified hashes (e.g., MD5, NTLM) with hashcat.

* **2025 NCAE Cyber Games Competition, Southwest Regional:** Achieved **Third Place**. I led a Red vs. Blue team event, specifically responsible for the configuration and management of a Linux BIND DNS server. Our team was the first to successfully deploy our DNS server.
